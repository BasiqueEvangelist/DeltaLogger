## DeltaLogger translations
DeltaLogger uses a server-side translations API to allow users to use the mod in
their native language. 

### How it works
As an example, we will add ``en_gb``. Copy the template found below into 
``src/main/resources/data/deltalogger/lang/en_gb.json`` and translate the strings.

#### Template
```
{
    "DeltaLogger inspect mode ":"",
    "on":"",
    "off":"",
    "No placements found at ":"",
    "You are using DeltaLogger version ":"",
    "Click to join the DeltaLogger discord":"",
    "Command resetpass error: must be logged in as user to reset password":"",
    "Your temporary password for DeltaLogger panel is ":"",
    "Please wait for ":"",
    " seconds before resetting your password":"",
    "No transactions found with the terms specified":"",
    "Transaction History":"",
    "Placement History":"",
    "No placements found at ":"",
    "No griefs found with the terms specified":"",
    "Grief History":"",
    "No placements found with the terms specified":""
}
```
